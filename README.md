## 1. AutoClicker
<<<<<<< HEAD
Just as easy as moving the cursor to the preferred position and press Enter, and it will AutoLeftClick forever usign pyautogui. 

## 2. UpworkNotificationCleaner
Upwork.com has no option to mark all notifications as read, so I made a script to automate that.
The script uses your browser's user data to go into upwork.com and clear only the 'New Job' notifications.
